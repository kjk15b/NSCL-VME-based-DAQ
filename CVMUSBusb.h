/*!
   This class is part of the support package for the Wiener/JTEC VM-USB 
   USB to VME interface.  This class is intended to be used in conjunction
   with CVMUSBReadoutList.
   CVMUSB is used to directly manipulate the controller and to perform
   single shot VME operations.   CVMEReadoutList is intended to be used
   to compose lists of VME operations that can either be run immediately
   by calling executeList or downloaded for triggered operation when
   data taking is turned on via loadList.

   The class is instantiated on a usb_device.  The list of usb_devices
   that correspond to VM-USB's is gotten via a call to the static function
   CVMUSB::enumerate().
